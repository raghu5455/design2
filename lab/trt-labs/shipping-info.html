                        <p>In the guide below, you'll find a culmination of our most "Frequently Asked Questions" in
                            regards to shipping, along with our detailed answers. </p>

                        <h5>WHERE IS MY ORDER?</h5>
                        <p>Once you place your order (and it's fulfilled by our Fulfillment Team), you will receive an
                            “Order Confirmation” email from us*. This email will contain all of your order details,
                            including order number, shipping address, billing address, and an itemized list of all
                            products (and flavors) ordered. </p>

                        <p>Once your order has shipped out from our fulfillment center, you will then receive a
                            “Shipping Confirmation” email from us**. If you selected a tracked shipping method, you will
                            receive your tracking information, along with the necessary steps to track your order,
                            within this email. Please note, orders are generally fulfilled same day or next business day
                        </p>

                        <p>If you’re unsure which shipping method you selected for your order, you can also find this
                            information available in your Order Confirmation email (which we send to you immediately
                            after we receive your order).</p>

                                order was received. All orders placed Friday-Saturday will ship on the following
                                Monday.</em></p>

                            gross weight of your order. To calculate the exact cost of shipping for your order, please

                        <p><strong>Please note: </strong> If you are a member of the U.S. Military, TRT Laboratories

                        <h5>AM I RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING CUSTOMS DUTIES AND IMPORT TAXES ON MY ORDER?</h5>
                        <p>Customs duties and taxes vary from country to country and several factors determine whether
                            or not your order will require them to be paid (by the customer). Please note that tax
                            percentages are applied to the net value of the purchase order, depending on the state where
                            you are located in. Unfortunately, TRT Laboratories does not control any of these factors.
                        </p>
                        <p>International orders shipped to countries outside of the United States may be subject to
                            import taxes and customs duties required by the destination country; however, most of our
                            International customers are not charged additional fees when they receive their shipment.
                        </p>
                        <p>Any additional charges for customs clearance must be paid by the recipient. Customs charges
                            and/or import duties are not included in the price of the order and TRT Laboratories cannot
                            anticipate whether or not you will be charged additional fees, or in what amount. As customs
                            policies vary so widely from country to country, we recommend contacting your local customs
                            office for additional details.
                        </p>
                        <p>If you do get charged an additional fee, the carrier will expect payment at the time of
                            delivery. If you refuse the shipment because of these charges, or if customs rejects an
                            order due to product restrictions, or if the order is returned (because the local post is
                            unable to locate your address), we will happily refund you for the cost of the product. This
                            does not include any shipping or return shipping fees once the package is returned and
                            processed by our fulfillment center.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Please note: </strong> packages returned by customs can often take a very long time,
                            and in some extreme cases, can take upwards of several months.</p>

                        <h5>I ENTERED THE WRONG ITEM/SHIPPING ADDRESS - CAN I CHANGE IT?</h5>
                        <p>Our Fulfillment team is very quick to process all inbound orders, to get your order shipped
                            and on its way to you as quickly as possible.</p>
                        <p>You may edit/update/remove any items from your order as much as you would like prior to
                            clicking “Complete Order.” After this point, you will be unable to make any changes or
                            amendments to your order, as our Fulfillment team will have already started processing and
                            preparing your order for delivery.</p>
                        <p>Once your order is processed, the products, flavors and shipping address are unable to be
                            amended.</p>
                        <p>If by chance, you entered the wrong shipping address and the order has been shipped, you will
                            be responsible for contacting the residence of the address you had initially entered (as
                            they will be receiving your order).</p>
                        <p>If you entered an address that does not exist, the order will make its way back to our
                            fulfillment center. Upon receiving, our Fulfillment Team can then redirect your order to
                            your correct address (if you’ve provided it to our Customer Service team) or provide a full
                            refund (product costs only).</p>
                        <p>If you entered any incorrect details regarding products (or flavors) and it has already
                            shipped from our facility, your order cannot be canceled (or amended) after this point, as
                            it has already shipped to you. Once received, if you still require changes to be made to
                            your order, you will be responsible for contacting our Customer Support team (and paying the
                            return postage), so that we can help you through our Returns/Exchanges policy.</p>
                        <p>TRT Laboratories is not liable for any losses incurred if the customer has provided any
                            incorrect details for their order. TRT Laboratories also reserves the right not to issue a
                            refund for product costs on orders never received, as a result of the incorrect details
                            provided.</p>

                        <h5>HOW CAN I TRACK MY ORDER?</h5>
                        <p>Once your order has shipped out from our fulfillment center, you will receive a “Shipping
                            Confirmation” email from us*. If you selected a tracked shipping method, you will receive

                            email.</p>
                        <p>If you are unsure which shipping method you selected for your order, you can find this
                            information available in your "Order Confirmation" email (which was sent immediately after
                            we received your order).</p>
                        <p><em>*Standard Shipping is the default shipping method (5-7 business days for Domestic orders
                                [which DOES come with tracking] and 14-21 working days for International orders).
                                Regarding Standard International Shipping Only: If you proceed with this default
                                shipping method, you accept and recognize that it is a non-tracked, non-prioritized
                                shipping service. </em></p>

                        <h5>HOW ARE SHIPPING DAYS CALCULATED?</h5>
                        <p>All "shipping days" refer to “business days” (Monday-Friday), which does not include weekends
                            (Saturday and Sunday) and holidays.</p>

                        <h5>I PLACED AN ORDER AND IT HASN’T BEEN RECEIVED</h5>
                        <h5>Domestic Orders</h5>
                        <p>If you chose our Standard Shipping, please make sure that you have tracked your order to find
                            out the status of your order. If tracking hasn’t updated in more than five days, please
                            contact our Customer Support Team for assistance at
                            <a href="mailto:support@trtlabs.com">support@trtlabs.com</a>
                        </p>

                        <h5>International Orders</h5>
                        <p>If you choose our Standard Shipping, you will not have any way to track your order, and
                            neither does our Customer Support Team. You can calculate the date your order should arrive
                            by starting with the date your order shipped (as given to you in your Shipping Confirmation
                            email) and count 14 business/working days. Remember, count only weekdays (Monday-Friday),
                            and do not count holidays when calculating your delivery date. However, as this is only an
                            estimated delivery date, we ask that you give delivery of your order at least another week
                            to see if your order arrives. Sometimes shipping delays occur.</p>

                        <h5>MY CREDIT CARD HAS BEEN CHARGED MORE THAN ONCE FOR MY ORDER</h5>
                        <p>If you tried to place an order and experienced an issue/received an error message (wrong CVV
                            code, wrong billing address, etc.) and then attempted to place a separate order, your credit
                            card summary may show multiple “authorizations.”</p>
                        <p><em><u>These are not actual charges and will be refunded back to your account soon, if they
                                    haven’t already.</u></em></p>

                        <h5>I TRIED TO PLACE AN ORDER AND RECEIVED AN ERROR MESSAGE THAT MY “ZIP CODE DOES NOT MATCH
                            THAT ASSOCIATED WITH MY CREDIT CARD.”</h5>
                        <p>If you try to place an order and receive this error message, or something similar to this,
                            it's typically a result of entering a billing address different from the one associated with
                            your credit card.</p>
                        <p>Usually, this is because you have recently moved and did not update your address with your
                            credit card company. You must use the exact billing address that your credit card company
                            has on file for you.</p>
                        <p>Otherwise, your order may not go through. You can use whichever shipping address that you
                            like, but the billing address must be what your credit card company has associated with that
                            particular credit card.</p>
                        <p>If, however, you know that you are using the billing address that your credit card company
                            has on file for you, then try placing your order through PayPal. This usually does the
                            trick.</p>

                        <h5>I RECEIVED A DISCOUNT CODE, AND THERE IS NO PLACE TO USE IT</h5>
                        <p>If you receive a discount code, you will need to enter it at the end of the checkout process,
                            on the last page where you choose a shipping method.</p>
                        <p>On the upper right-hand side of the page, you will see a box that says “Gift Card or Discount
                            Code” and next to it is a gray box that says “APPLY.”</p>
                        <p>Just enter your discount code in the box and don’t forget to click the “APPLY” button after
                            you enter it. If you don’t click the “APPLY” button, you will not receive your discount.</p>

                        <h5>I LIVE IN HAWAII AND MY ORDER IS TAKING UNUSUALLY LONG TO ARRIVE</h5>
                        <p>If you placed an order for delivery to Hawaii and purchased our “Standard” shipping, please
                            be advised that this shipping method is shipped by the USPS, is considered a “Parcel Post,”
                            and may ship by truck or boat. Sometimes, this method can take as long as 30 days for
                            delivery.</p>
                        <p>The best way around this is to purchase USPS Priority Mail 2-Day Shipping or any of the other
                            shipping methods which are presented at the end of checkout.</p>

                        <h5>ACCORDING TO MY TRACKING LINK, MY ORDER WAS DELIVERED, BUT I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANYTHING</h5>
                        <p>Before contacting our Customer Service Team, we recommend that you first look all over your
                            property as the USPS may have left your package in a safe location, away from the view of
                            the public. Also, please check with your family members and neighbors to see if they have
                            seen your package.</p>
                        <p>If you live in an apartment complex, your package may have been delivered to either: a
                            “Parcel Locker,” (you should have been given a key by the USPS for this Parcel Locker) or to
                            your Leasing Office or Manager’s Office.</p>
                        <p>If you do not find your package, we suggest contacting your local Post Office, make sure to
                            give them your tracking number, and explain that according to tracking your order has was
                            delivered, but you have not received anything.</p>
                        <p>If none of the above help you, please contact our Customer Service Team at <a

                        <h5>DOES DHL OR THE USPS DELIVER MY ORDER?</h5>
                        <h5>Domestic Orders</h5>
                        <p>If you purchased our standard shipping method, your order is picked up from our warehouse by
                            DHL and delivered to the Postal Hub for your address for delivery by the USPS. The tracking
                            number you received will show up on the DHL tracking page OR the USPS tracking page. But the
                            USPS is ultimately responsible for delivering your order.</p>

                        <h5>DO YOU SHIP TO FPO, APO, OR DPO ADDRESSES?</h5>
                        <p>We do ship to FPO, APO, and DPO addresses. However, there is currently a shipping delay when
                            delivering our orders to these addresses. Listed below are the Department of Defense (DoD)

                            guarantee delivery within 2 business days. Therefore, we cannot guarantee you will receive
